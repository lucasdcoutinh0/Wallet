# DApp Wallet

This project is the most easier way to interact with one smart contract. In this simple DApp we can check our balance and send a amount of BRLC (An ERC20 token created by me) for different accounts. 
DApp is the Future.

### About the Project

The wallet was builded using react.js as main framework. We also have solidity been used to do and deploy the smart contracts of the ERC20 Token. To do the connection between React and solidity we are using ethers.js
